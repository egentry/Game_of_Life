##Main Objectives
  - Implement a serial, and then parallel version of Conway's Game of Life
  - Create a theoretical performance model and evaluate it using empirical runtime data


 

##Requires
  - gcc (makefile can be adapted to use other compilers
  - mpicc
  - For visualization:
    - Python (tested for v.3, probably backwards compatible)
    - IPython 3
    - Matplotlib
    - Numpy
